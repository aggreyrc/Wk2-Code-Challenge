# Wk2-Code-Challenge

This is a project to create a website with a shopping list.
The user is able to add items to the list,mark them as purchased,edit them or clear the list when they are done.
These were the requirements of the project:
Array: Maintain a JavaScript array to store shopping list items.

    DOM Manipulation:
1. Create an HTML structure with an input field for adding items, a list container to display items, and buttons for "Add", "Mark Purchased", and "Clear List".
2. Use JavaScript to dynamically add new items to the list container when the user clicks the "Add" button. (The new items do not have to be persisted once the page refreshes)
3. Update the list item visually to indicate purchased items (e.g., strike-through text, different background color).

    Event Handling:
1. Attach event listeners to the "Add" button to capture user input and add items to the list.
2. Attach event listeners to the list of items to allow users to mark them as purchased.
3. Attach an event listener to the "Clear List" button to remove all items from the list.
